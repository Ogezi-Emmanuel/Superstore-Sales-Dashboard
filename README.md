# Superstore Sales Dashboard

## 1. Project Objective
The goal of this project was to analyze the Superstore sales data to identify key trends, top-performing products and regions, and uncover profitability insights. The final output is an interactive dashboard created in Google Sheets that allows stakeholders to explore the data and make informed business decisions.

## 2. Data Source
The dataset used is the "Sample - Superstore" dataset, which contains sales data for a fictional retail chain.
* **Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/juhi1994/superstore)

## 3. Tools Used
* **Google Sheets:** Used for data cleaning, analysis (Pivot Tables), and dashboard creation (Charts, Slicers).

## 4. The Process
* **Data Cleaning:** Checked for and removed duplicate entries. Standardized data formats for dates and currency.
* **Feature Engineering:** Created new columns for `Order Year`, `Order Month`, and `Shipping Time (Days)` to enable deeper analysis.
* **Data Analysis:** Used Pivot Tables to aggregate data and answer key business questions.
* **Dashboard Creation:** Built an interactive dashboard with KPIs, charts, and slicers to present the findings in a user-friendly way.

## 5. Key Findings & Visualizations
* **Key Finding 1: The 'Tables' sub-category is consistently unprofitable.**
  Despite generating significant sales, the Tables sub-category consistently loses money for the company. This suggests that the costs associated with these products, or the   discounts applied, are too high, and this product line requires an immediate strategic review.

* **Key Finding 2: The West region leads in both sales and profitability.**
  The West region is the top performer by a significant margin. There's a clear opportunity to analyze the successful strategies, customer demographics, or product mix in      the West and potentially apply these learnings to other regions, especially the lower-performing Central region.

* **Key Finding 3: A small group of "power customers" drives a significant portion of revenue.**
  The top 10 customers account for a disproportionately high amount of total revenue. This highlights the importance of customer retention programs and personalized             marketing for these key accounts to ensure continued business growth.
